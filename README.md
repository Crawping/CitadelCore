# CitadelCore
Cross platform filtering HTTP/S proxy based on .NET Standard 2.0.

CitadelCore supports proxying of both HTTP/S and Websocket (Ws/Wss) connections. CitadelCore's Websocket proxy passes the Autobahn Test Suite.

For the Windows specific implementation, please see [CitadelCore.Windows](https://github.com/TechnikEmpire/CitadelCore.Windows).
