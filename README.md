# CitadelCore
Cross platform filtering HTTP/S proxy based on .NET Standard 2.0.

CitadelCore supports proxying of both HTTP/S and Websocket (Ws/Wss) connections. As of v1.4.2, CitadelCore's Websocket proxy passes the [Autobahn Test Suite](https://github.com/TechnikEmpire/CitadelCore/releases/download/v1.4.2/autobahn-testsuite-results.zip).
